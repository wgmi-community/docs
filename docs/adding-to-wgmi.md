# Part 1: About WGMI
This section will dive into our history, what we stand for, why we're here, and where we're headed. 

In each section, you'll learn a little more about us, and if you like what you see, head to our Membership & Acess Section to learn more about getting involved. 

## What is WGMI? 

> **"Why hire a Community Manager when you can hire a Community of Community Managers?" - Oops, Core Contributor**

WGMI is a Web3 Community Development, Strategy, and Coordination service provider. 

Currently, WGMI DAO is providing Community development and management services for Ethereum-compatible Web3 projects or DAOs. 

As we grow and as Ethereum scales, we will be allocating time and resources to onboarding the next generation of Web3 Community Professionals.

To convert them from Web3 newbies and/or Community amateurs, our goal is to educate and open source Community Management best practices.

Over time— WGMI DAO will be an organism that creates a funnel for prospective Community talent in the ecosystem...prepares them to manage Communities themselves... and ultimately curates work for them as bounties governed by the DAO.

## Our Vision & Values
### WGMI is Community-First
Our Community comes first. We are focused on solving community-building hurdles in the Ethereum ecosystem. To achieve this, we prioritize building relationships, adding value, giving our members a voice and inclusivity, and using decentralized tools and frameworks. Our success will come from the Community's willingness to collaborate, contribute and self-organize.

   - [Arweave Community First Manifesto](https://wnpukta6xzoz.arweave.net/731xyEhi1L6OMzxIRwt0PZocO3oYu-og_-qfjq335Hs)
            
### WGMI *is* Ethereum
Ethereum is the future composable, sovereign/self-custodial, decentralized, interoperable internet of value. Anybody with access to an internet connection should be able to learn how to build online communities, get paid without intermediaries, create tokenized incentives or permissions, and distribute ownership over time to those that helped build the Community. Ethereum is not just "crypto"; it's how we will work in the future.

**Further Reading:**
   - [Learn more about Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/learn/)
  
### Anybody can build a Community
Being a Member of a Community is earned, not given. 
Anybody can lurk in most communities. Being a member takes time, contribution, and dedication. It's important that you advocate for yourself, build strong relationships, give evidence of your contributions, and get buy-in or consensus for all the work you are putting in.

### Web3 communities are transparent, sovereign, open, and decentralized
We're not a perfect DAO or Community. Our goal will always be focused on ensuring our Community is decentralized, transparent, for the people, inclusive, automated, yet human-centric, and maintaining that urge to open source everything!

## Our Code of Conduct

When a Community member joins the WGMI community, some rules will need to be followed. 

These rules are set in place to help with the harmonious standard within the server to encourage and help others learn and blossom into outstanding community members of Wgmi. 

We have a zero-tolerance policy. If you do not comply, we will kick you from the server and/or assign you soulbound NFTs that ban you from participating in Community activities. We do not look to punish our Community; instead, we're looking to create a safe, inclusive, and creative space for our people.

**Here are some House Rules in the Wgmi Discord server:**
- Don't be an asshole
- No promotion of unrelated 3rd party platforms or applications
- No unrelated (overtly promotional) links or Discord servers

- Have some fucking fun... we're building future internet communities!

## Why WGMI? 
We're putting the WE in Web3.

Building Communities online was destined since the computer, internet, and the web was invented. As we enter this new epoch of Web3 and onward, we (as an industry) are in dire need of Community professionals who can lead this online coordination around Web3 projects, products, tools, platforms, developer environments, protocols, tokens—you name it.

Community development and management is hard work.

That's why it's difficult to find seasoned, talented, holistic (knowledgeable of Web3 primitives and Community strategies), and committed individuals to manage your Web3 or Ethereum projects. Web3 projects are dying to onboard suitable candidates, and future Community Managers are just now discovering this is a career path...Wgmi is looking to close that gap for the Ethereum ecosystem.

## What's worse than Moloch? The Machine.

Moloch, the demon of coordination failure, is the bane of DAOs existence. To make it worse, as online Communities, we're destined to fall into many more problems, including the soulless, dystopian, machine-owned, bot-controlled, Discord-hosted future. All of us, programmed to talk to one another, unaware of who is real, who is a bot...none of us unique in our ideas, mere calculations and automations rather than understanding, compassion, feeling. Communities are our strength. They're what makes what we do...human.

![](https://i.imgur.com/09DjUe5.png)

The way we see it, our perfect world will be a collection of Communities empowered by a relationship with automation, bots, tools, and code. Not the other way around.

Both coordination and efficiency failures remain the looming demon that prevents DAOs and communities from achieving a common goal. Wgmi stands tall, facing both Moloch and the Machine with clenched fists... 

Our role as Community Professionals is to be the nervous system of the Community. To feel what members, contributors, developers, and stakeholders hold close. To communicate those feelings, inform, educate, and solve issues that the entire organism should embody.

## Building Community in Web3

Building "Community" is about creating feedback loops at scale and instilling the human element behind a project, product, application, protocol, token, or even network infrastructure. This boils down to growth, engagement, retention, conversion to contributor-ship, activity on-chain— and I hate that we've gotten here— but the value of treasury for certain projects.

We're all here building toward the present and future internet of value. As Ethereum and EVM-compatible projects scale, we will need to coordinate future collaborators to drive these projects over time.

**Web3 Communities should be paving the way for:**

- Anybody with access to the internet can participate 
- Opportunities to contribute 
- Paths for deeper involvement and ownership
- Transparent voting process weighted toward those who contributed

***Does a Community need to have a token? No. Does a Community need to be a DAO? No. Is a DAO a Web3 "Community"? Not always.***

The real value of Community is creating ways for users, developers, members, and financiers— to signal, support, and govern the projects they love. The future of Community Management/ Development will be dictated by how effectively we can achieve that as a collective. Although KPIs, metrics, and tokenization can help— the real aha moment is the sense of place, belonging, coordination, and shared value creation.

## Why is Wgmi a DAO?
If you're growing a decentralized Community at scale—you will need a lot of humans. Thinking through Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, some incentives need to be considered to spark human contribution and engagement. In a traditional sense, folks have created Community Management consultancies to help companies build their Community strategies and execution. With a DAO.. we can do oh, so much more... 

Imagine this... Web3 is the venue where users, developers, and institutions can own pieces of the internet... what if the Community could own and hold their % share of "Community" in Web3?

What if we could incentivize the best Community builders to join us, contribute, and open source their experiences to newcomers in the space?

Why hire a Community Manager when you could hire a Community of Community Managers?....

## Departures & Exists
### Community Kick
We reserve the right to kick you from our server if you violate our Code of Conduct. 

For Contributors, a proposal can be made to kick a Contributor. For more info, visit [types of proposals]. 


### The art of the RageQuit
Members may "RageQuit" and exit the DAO on their own terms. This will grant them a return of their pro rata value of the DAO treasury. 

If the DAO does not believe a Member is acting in good faith or has been contributing to the success of the DAO— they may be voted out of the DAO via the "RageKick" proposal. That Member would then be forcibly allocated their pro rata share of the DAO treasury upon exit.

## DAO Operation Manual
Let's get into how we get things done at WGMI... 


---

### Overview

All shares are non-transferrable and unique to the DAO. 

They are assigned to your Ethereum address. 

Each share represents a pro-rata claim on the underlying capital pool and can be exchanged at any time using the Ragequit feature.

There is no cap on the number of shares that can be issued, and each share carries one vote.

All new shares are issued at the current exchange rate (.69 ETH at the time of this writing), and new members may request a maximum of 100 shares when joining.

| Status | Distribution | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- 
| Summoner   | 35 Shares | Guided the DAO through initial development, vision, manifesto, and deployment
| Co-Summoners | 5 Shares | Supported the initial deployment, contribution, and development

### DAOHaus and Moloch TL;DR

DAOHaus operates Moloch v2 or v3 framework. 

DAOHaus is a platform that makes gives Moloch smart contracts a human interface. It is compatible with/on Ethereum Mainnet, Gnosis Chain, Polygon, and other EVM-compatible L1s protocols.

***Wgmi DAO utilizes the Moloch V3 framework on Gnosis Chain.***

Moloch was popularized due to its Minimum Viable DAO design and the advent of "ragequit" - a means for members to exit the DAO by exchanging their shares for a pro-rata claim on the Bank's assets.

Moloch V2 allows for an optimized DAO Bank and new Proposal Types. Moloch V2 can hold a variety of ERC20 tokens and allows anyone (including those without shares) to make a proposal to the DAO.

[Moloch v3](https://github.com/Moloch-Mystics/moloch-v3) comes packed with simpler code, adaptable smart contracts without the need to audit the entire code every time, and upgradable modules. Some features include transferrable DAO shares.

---

### Operating the DAO

1. [Go to DAOHaus](https://app.daohaus.club/)
2. Connect to Web3 ✨sign in with Metamask✨
3. Go to WGMI DAO
4. Vote on proposals
5. Create proposals

---

### Features Overview

The DAOhaus platform helps us manage stakeholders within our DAO (i.e., Members). Members are people or organizations that own Shares and Loot in MolochDAO. Members can own both Shares and/or Loot.

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B146qpnyi.png)

When a Member owns Shares, they have an economic share of the funds in the DAO's Bank and voting rights in the DAO's Proposals.

When a Member owns only Loot, they only have an economic share of the funds in the DAO's Bank but no voting rights in the DAO's Proposals. This enables the DAO to raise a $ treasury without diluting voting power to external supporters or financiers.

Non-members can join the DAO by requesting Shares / Loot via a Membership Proposal. Members can leave the DAO through a RageQuit proposal, thereby withdrawing their pro-rated ownership of the Bank's funds.

---

### Proposals & Voting

Decision-making is done via Proposals, which will need to be voted on by Members (based on their respective Share counts)

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hy-liTnki.png)

---

### Common types of Proposals

- Membership - Tributing capital and Requesting new shares to join the DAO
- Funding - Tributing or Requesting funds from the DAO to work on internal projects and improvements
- Whitelist - Request to add support for a new ERC20 token
- GuildKick - Request to forcibly remove a malicious member through a vote
- Minion - A contract that allows execution of arbitrary calls, i.e., swapping assets in the DAO bank

---

### The stages for Proposals:

- Submit Proposal
- Sponsor Proposal
- In Queue
- Voting Period
- Grace Period
- Ready for Processing
- Completed

---

### Bank & Token
The Bank holds all the DAO funds, which include ERC-20 (excluding native tokens such as ETH, xDAI, and MATIC on the respective chains) and ERC-721 NFTs.

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJcEo62Ji.png)

Native tokens must be wrapped first before being sent to the Bank. Alternatively, DAOs can set up a Minion that allows the holding of native tokens.

For an ERC-20 token to show up in the Bank's balance, the DAO must whitelist the Token via a Whitelist Proposal (Tutorial here).


---

### Minion & Boosts
Beyond the core functions of managing membership, proposals, and funds, DAOhaus has Minions and Boosts that help to add extra functionality to your DAO (you can think of them like apps)

Boosts, in general, give you extra functionality to your DAO (e.g., adding a Discord bot to your DAO).

If you need to interact with smart contracts (e.g., swapping tokens, managing LP positions, etc.), Minion help you with making arbitrary calls to smart contracts. 

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJ2-SZ2Jo.png)

---

## Bank Overview

The Bank is MolochDAO's bank account, which supports ERC-20 tokens and ERC-721 NFTs.

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJOG0T2Jo.png)

If your Bank Vault holds NFTs, there will be a gallery to view all your DAO's NFTs.

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bkx70phJj.png)

The Bank Vault only supports ERC-20 tokens, so if you receive native tokens such as ETH, you will need senders to wrap the tokens before sending. RaidGuild built an excellent tool just for this purpose.

---

### How Ownership Works

All members share direct ownership of the Bank based on their Shares and/or Loot in relation to one another. Shares grant voting power as well as a claim to the Bank funds, whereas Loot only grants you rights to the funds in the Bank.

To help you visualize, here is an example of a simple DAO with 600 DAI in the Bank.

| Member | Shares | Loot | Voting Power | Exit Value |
|--------|--------|------|--------------|------------|
| Alice  | 10     | 0    | 25%          | 100 DAI    |
| Bob    | 10     | 10   | 25%          | 200 DAI    |
| Chris  | 20     | 0    | 50%          | 200 DAI    |
| Dani   | 0      | 10   | 0%           | 100 DAI    |
| Total  | 40     | 20   | 100%         | 600 DAI    |

In the above example, as Bob has 10 / 40 shares, he has 25% of the voting power. If he wants to withdraw from the Bank, he can claim 33% of the funds (200 DAI) because the sum total of his Shares + Loot takes up 33% of the total.

As Dani has no Shares, she has no voting power. If she wants to withdraw from the Bank, her ten (10) loot grants her 16% of the Bank funds (96 DAI)

When members RageQuit or are Guild Kick-ed, this is how their Exit Amounts are calculated.

---

### Minion Vaults
Another way to hold funds is through Minions. Minions enable your DAO to call arbitrary contracts, enabling you to do many things such as manage ENS, collect NFTs, manage treasury in DeFi, etc. 

As Minions can also hold ERC-20 tokens, they are useful for holding funds that will eventually interact with smart contracts (e.g., Payroll, Superfluid, etc.)

As the Minion balance is separate from the Bank's balance, the Exit Amount during RageQuits does not take into account Minion Balances. 

The DAO will need to calculate the Member's fair share of the Bank + Minion Balances to ensure accuracy in Exit Amounts.

---

### Common Bank Use Cases

#### Adding & Whitelisting ERC-20 Tokens
The Bank Vault can support valid ERC-20 tokens, but for it to show on the Bank Vault UI, you will need to submit and pass a Proposal to whitelist the Token. Once the Token is whitelisted, the Bank should show the ERC-20 tokens.

#### Adding Tributes to join a DAO
When new members would like to add tributes to join, you will need to submit a Membership Proposal and indicate your tributes provided and shares requested. Currently, only ERC-20 tributes are available, but ERC-721 NFT tributes are coming soon.

#### Requesting Funding from the Bank
If you'd like to request Funding from the Bank, submit a Funding Proposal and indicate the funds owed to you.

---

## Membership
Let's get into DAO Membership... 
### Members
A characteristic that wasn't widely prominent in the Web3 world before the advent of DAOs, is that of having "Skin in the Game." This unique feature allows DAO members to signal their loyalty and commitment to their respective organizations and provides DAOs with a mechanism for preventing possibly malicious actors from joining.

Membership in a DAO can be seamless, easy in/easy out. Prospective members can submit a Membership Proposal by navigating to the DAO they're interested in and selecting View Proposals, subsequently clicking New Proposal and Membership; existing members can vote on whether to accept or deny admission of candidates on a case-by-case basis.

Members can exit at any time, as long as they don't have a 'Yes' vote on an open proposal.

---

### Shares
Shares are granted to members to allow them to vote on proposals in the DAO. Shares also represent a claim on the tokens held in the DAO. Shares can neither be exchanged nor sold to other members of the DAO.

---

### Loot
Non-voting Shares in the DAO. Guilders can ragequit Loot to withdraw the proportional amount of assets from the DAO based on current Share Value.

---

### Ragequit
This is part of the magic of Moloch. RageQuit allows a member or Loot holder of the DAO to leave with all or part of their share of the tokens. Imagine a DAO with 1000 DAI, 50 Shares, and 50 Loot. That means if you own 10 Shares of the DAO and ragequit all of your shares, you'd leave with 100 DAI or 10% of the treasury.

### GuildKick
A proposal to kick out a member of the DAO. Converts any Shares they may have into Loot, thereby removing voting power. Warning once a member is Guild kicked, they become jailed and cannot be added as a member ever again.

### Jailed
Status of a member after a successful guildkick. They can be ragekicked at this time.

### RageKick
After a successful GuildKick, anyone can ragekick that Member. Ragekick acts exactly as a ragequit, burning their Loot and returning their proportionate tokens.

---
## Minions
Let's learn a bit more about minions... 
### What are Minions?
Minions enable our DAO to make calls and interact with external smart contracts to empower our DAO to do everything you want with a smart contract. When you submit, vote, and pass a Minion Proposal, the Minion will execute your smart contract calls the way it was created to.

This opens up possibilities for DAOs to access any smart contracts out there, from providing liquidity positions, doing swaps, or even purchasing NFTs.

---

### Minion Types
#### Basic Minion

Want a simple way to execute smart contract calls automatically based on the outcome of your proposals? Also known as a vanilla minion, it is a basic upgrade to your DAO proposals, enabling one-time interactions with other smart contracts once your proposals are passed. This way, you can upgrade your DAO experience by seamlessly going from voting to execution without any coordination lags.

#### Advanced Minion
The Advanced Minion is similar to the Basic Minion but has the added ability to set quorum levels so that transactions can be executed earlier once quorum requirements are met, also known as a Nifty Minion.

### Safe Minion
Deploying a Minion and a Gnosis Safe, this Minion stores and manages funds in a Gnosis Safe and supports complex multi-call transactions. This Boost is perfect for advanced DAOs looking to trade NFTs, manage LP positions in AMMs, or do other arbitrary transactions. To increase proposal velocity for less critical proposals, setting quorum levels enables early execution when a minimum quorum is met.

### Superfluid Minion
The SuperFluid Minion helps automate ongoing streams of payments via the SuperFluid Protocol to vendors, other DAOs, and any addresses. Set it up once, and your payments will automatically stream in real-time as long as your minion vault has sufficient funds.


---

## Your DAO Profile  
Here's what you need to know... 

---


### Member Profile
Anyone who is a member, or has some funds in internal balances, will have a profile view within the DAO.

From here, you can:
- View Shares/Loot and Exit Amount (pro-rata claim on banks assets based on current share value)
- View recent activity within the DAO
- View and withdraw any internal balances
- Ragequit


---

## DAO Proposals
Proposals can be used for all types of decision-making in the DAO. Add/remove members, allocate Shares and Loot, distribute funds, and even interact with other applications and communities.

---


### Types of Proposals 
There are four levels of proposals at WGMI. Each level allows for different actions and are used for various purposes.


---

**1. Member & Council Proposals**
The Highest Level of Proposal is the `Member & Council Proposal` (as it's known on DAOhaus). These proposals are used to make the most critical changes to the DAO. Some examples of Member & Council proposals are Wgmi Improvement Proposals(WIP), Funding Proposal at the DOA level, or Membership in the DAO Council. 

**Further Reading:** [Please see Member & Council Proposal Templates for more information](XXXXXXXXXXXXX)

---

**2. Guild Proposals**
The second level of Proposal is the `Guild Proposal.` These proposals are provided and executed at the Guild level. Think of Guilds as a group for working contributors to collaborate. Within this proposal type, some examples of proposals include but are not limited to: 

        - Guild Guide Nomination or Rage kick
        - Guild Contributor Nomination or Rage kick
        - Project Proposal
        - Multisig funding approval 
        - Guild Season Proposal

**Further Reading:** [Please see Guild Proposal Templates for more information](XXXXXXXXXXXXX)



---


**3. Signal Proposals**
The third level of Proposal is at the **Contributor** Level and is called a `Signal Proposal.` A Signal proposal is a general purpose proposal used for operational decision-making within the DAO. These are Contributor focused because contributors are the cornerstone of Wgmi, holding us together. Some examples of a signal proposal can include but are not limited to: 

        - Wgmi Improvement Proposals(WIP)
        - General Funding
        - Membership
        - Other Operational decisions

***Further Reading:***
   - [Please see Signal Proposal Templates for more information](XXXXXXXXXXXXX)  

---


**4. Open Source Proposals**
The Fourth level of Proposal is at the **Community** Level and is called an `Open Source Proposal.` An Open Source Proposal is a general purpose proposal for community decision-making. Some examples of an Open Source Proposal can include but are not limited to: 

        - Wgmi Improvement Proposals(WIP)
        - General Funding
        - Membership
        - Other Community decisions

**Further Reading:** [Please see Open Source Proposal Templates for more information](XXXXXXXXXXXXX)  


---

### Standard Proposal Types
These are the standard proposal types used within the governance in most DAOs.

**Membership:** Tributing capital and Requesting new shares to join the DAO

**Funding:** Tributing Spoils or Requesting funds from the DAO to work on internal projects and improvements

**Token:** Request to add support for a new ERC20 token

**Trade:** Request the DAO to swap one asset for another within the War Chest

**GuildKick:** Request to forcibly remove a malicious member through a vote

**Minion:** A contract that allows execution of arbitrary calls, i.e., swapping assets in the DAO bank

***Additional Considerations:*** 
- With additional Minions and Boosts, more proposal types will be available for your DAO (e.g., "Superfluid" for Superfluid Minion, etc.)


---

### Proposal Process
To submit a proposal, navigate to MolochDAO and select **"View Proposals"** followed by New Proposal.

Select the Proposal Type (described above) and fill in the relevant information.

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyP8-Ahki.png)

The default Proposal Type shown will be the "Favorites" proposals. If you cannot find your proposals in "Favorites," try toggling to another Proposal Playlist.

**Here's your basic proposal format:**

- **TITLE: Enter a description of the Proposal** (e.g., New Member - Vitalik Buterin)

- **DESCRIPTION:** Anything you believe is relevant to your Proposal. The shorter the description, the better, and the important piece here is the WHAT you are asking for and WHY.

- **LINK:** Whatever information gives us the best context to review your Proposal and make an informed decision.

- **APPLICANT:** With respect to funding proposals, this is the recipient or sender address you would like to have funds sent to or from.

- **PAYMENT REQUESTED:** The number of Shares or amount of payment requested. Payment can be requested in any token held by the DAO or in shares and Loot.

- **+REQUEST SHARES:** Voting shares in the DAO. If it is a funding proposal, Members can request payment be made in shares up to x% of the total amount requested.

- **+REQUEST LOOT:** Non-voting shares in the DAO. This means you will have shares which can be ragequit but do not hold voting rights. Loot shares cost the same as regular shares.

- **GIVE TRIBUTE:** The amount of capital you are committing to deposit to the DAO bank. (Tribute is relevant to Membership and Funding Proposals).

**Here are a few good examples:** 
<!-- - [DAOHaus Funding]()
- [Metacartel New Member]() -->

---

### Stages of a Proposal

**1. Submit a Proposal**
Anyone, even non-members, can submit proposals to the DAO.

**2. Sponsor Proposal**
After submitting a proposal, it will enter the Unsponsored Proposals section. This means someone with shares (which could be you) must Champion the Proposal in order for it to be moved to Voting.

**Note:** *You can sponsor your own Proposal, but it is recommended that another member sponsor it so they can make sure you have filled out the Proposal with the correct information and you get the result you intended for.*

Only members can 'Sponsor' the Proposal, sending it to the Queue.

**3. In Queue**
Once the Proposal has been sponsored, it will enter the Queue. The Queue ensures proposals are funneled to Voting in an orderly fashion. One Proposal will go from the Queue to the Voting Period in a time frame specified by the summoners of your DAO.

**4. Voting Period**
Once in the Voting Period, members can now vote on the Proposal. Every Proposal has an 'x' amount of time in the voting period where it must receive more Yes than No votes to pass.

**5. Grace Period**
Voting is over, and the Proposal is set to pass or fail depending on the votes cast during Voting. Members who voted No, and have no other pending Yes votes, can ragequit during this period.


**6. Ready for Processing**
Next, The Proposal is sent to Processing, in which the vote is time stamped on-chain.


**7. Completed**
After being processed, the Proposal is marked as Completed, and all shares, funds, or outcomes are executed as specified in the Proposal. All proposal outcomes that affect you can be viewed by clicking your Address (top right) and selecting View Member Profile.

# Part Four: Our Guilds & Cohorts 

---

## Guild Overview
Guilds are our territory. These like-minded members work, learn, innovate, and create together. There are always new areas for *Guilds* to expand into, so jump in.

| Type | Description |
 -------- | -------- |
|Community Guild |Leading the vision and execution behind Community building, management, and development in Web3
|Service Guild| Responsible for providing Community professional services to external Web3 projects by delegating work to the DAO
|Marketing Guild |Creating traffic, high visibility, and growth for Wgmi 
|Operations Guild| Setting standards behind the operations of the DAO, supporting Service Guild projects, and leading project management
|Education Guild| Creating learning modules from "Cohorts," projects, and initiatives that can be shared
|Governance Guild| Creating governance best practices between Community, Contributors, and Members— off-chain and on-chain
|Builders Guild| Focused on shipping tools, platforms, bots, and protocols that benefit Web3 Community builders
|Treasury Guild| Adding value to the treasury by implementing DeFi sustainability or rebalancing strategies and implementing financial accounting
|Contributor Experience Group| Ensuring DAO contributors are given the best experience in the DAO
|DAO Council| Our core governing and executing body of the DAO. 


---

###  Joining Guilds

Guilds help us establish territory. 

These are collectives and functions within the DAO that are accountable for creating guidelines, strategies, and proposals that align with the DAO's overarching goals— but at a team level. We can be more efficient as an organization if we can divide and conquer the work and thought leadership. 

#### Some of our Guilds: 
- Community 
- Growth 
- Service
- Ops
- Governance
- Treasury
- Council

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJe1txhyi.png)


---

### Start with these four (4) steps!
**1. Go to the `#start-here` category in Discord.**

**2. Introduce yourself in the `# introductions` channel**
    - We like to see folks talk about their interest in the industry, how they found Wgmi, their strengths, and what they're looking to get out of this Community. We're all here to meet people, so don't be shy!

**3. Head over to the `#path-selection` channel**

**4. React to the `Contributor` emoji**
    - To show your interest as a contributor to the Wgmi DAO. 

**5. Now, choose your Guild (s)!**
    - Once you have reacted to the above, the `Guild Selection` channel will appear. You will then be able to choose your Guild according to your interests and skills. Select at will! 
    
> Heads Up: Be careful of which Guilds you subscribe to. We want everyone to experiment, but there will be unique notifications for Discord updates at each Guild level.

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJc-Ylhyi.png)

---

### Summoning a Guild

There are two main ways to summon a guild. The first is developing into a sub-guild, identifying a need, and spinning off into a focused guild. The second is to create a brand new guild.

 Sub-guilds or Guild contributors identifying a need for a focused guild can come together to form a new guild when there is substantial support from the current Guild and DAO council. From here, you will need to start on the proposal process in `#dao-proposals.`

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

<p>Substantial support is defined as support to fill the identified need, not out of negative intentions</p>

</div>


 To summon a brand new guild, you first need to make sure that one does not exists that meets the criteria you are looking for. If this is true, you will need to start on a proposal in `#dao-proposals.` It is important to note that guilds are meant to cast a wide net and naturally develop sub-guilds to ensure growth and operational demand exists.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

<p>Please see Governance Process for an overview on DAO proposals*</p>

</div>


---

## Cohort Overview  

---

### Joining Cohorts 
As an apprentice, you will find "Cohorts" or working groups for various projects. Jump in, do the work and keep track of your output!

As a contributor, you can summon "Cohorts" and/ or request to lead a cohort. You can also join "Cohorts" and continue to support initiatives.

As a Guild Guide, you will have the governance to approve "Cohorts" or working groups, lead the voting process around working group priorities, and be accountable for reporting via a proposal to DAO Council.

---

### Summoning a Cohort
Project ideas can originate from anywhere at any time. They can come from DAO members, contributors, or apprentices.

A Guild should sponsor each Project, and that Guild will be responsible for seeing it through to completion. 
*This does not exclude Guilds from working together on projects*

A project's path to completion will look different depending on the needs of the Project. 

### Projects Categories:

**Funding Required:** The DAO must approve projects that require Funding. 
- Approval may be granted from the Guild Guides if there are funds available in their budgets
*Examples: Funding Grants, Hiring Staff, Sponsoring Events*

**Funding Not Required:** Projects that can be accomplished without Funding need soft approval from the Guild Guide.
- *Examples: Marketing Campaigns, Discord Re-orgs, Onboarding efforts*

### Typical Project Lifecycle:
1. Idea
2. Discussion in Discord
3. Guild Sponsors Idea via Proposal (soft governance)
4. Funding Required?
    - (if Yes, go to 5, if not, go to 8)
5. Can the Project be funded by Guild Allocations? 
    - (if Yes, go to 8, if not, go to 6)
6. Move Discussion to Discourse for broader consensus
7. Move to DAOhaus for the vote
8. Assign work and spin up Coordinape Epoch
9. Finish Project and allocate via Coordinape
10. Contributors withdraw funds at their convenience

#### Each "Cohort" will have a template process provided by each Guild Guide and maintained by Governance/ Ops Guilds. 

 ##### Example Template:
- Name of Project 
- Project Lead Name
- Guild Sponsor
- Abstract (summary of the Proposal)
- Purpose of this workgroup/sprint/project (motivation)
- Workgroup members (who is involved)
	- Name (username, Discord)
	- Roles (who's doing what)
	- Responsibilities (their owned work)
	- It should also include or denote folks who are Cross-functional guild members
- Project Vision (what you're hoping to accomplish)
- What tasks will be available to contribute to apprentices?
- Project timelines/milestones (allows for multi-season projects)
- Operating Procedures (how you will work)
	- When will you meet
	- How will you share updates
- Funding requested (how much and how it will be allocated + wallet address it's sent to)
- Anticipated Benefits (how does it support or vision)
- Potential drawbacks (how could this negatively impact the dao)



---

## Contributing to a Project 
Anyone can contribute to a project, but to keep some order to the chaos, tasks will be assigned to proven contributors first by the project lead. 

**Project Leads** will be responsible for scoping tasks, giving an estimate for when the Project will be completed to the Guild, and keeping the Guild updated with weekly updates. 
    
**Contributors** will be responsible for accomplishing their assigned tasks and regularly communicating and coordinating with project leads and other contributors.

**Apprentices** will be paired with a contributor during the Project to learn the ropes of how to contribute to WGMI. After an apprentice has completed ??? Projects, they will be eligible to be a solo contributor or project lead


---

## Getting paid ✨ (NEEDS ATTENTION)
Every Project will have its budget. That budget will be used to compensate the contributors, purchase items for the Project, and improve the DAO.
Depending on the Project's timeline, payment will be distributed at the completion of the Project or monthly, whichever is shorter. 

A project will be considered complete when the Guild Guide signs off on its completion.

Compensation will take place via **Coordinape Circles**. The Project Lead will be responsible for ensuring the appropriate contributors are in the circle and ensuring the Epochs are scheduled appropriately. 

Contributors will get paid through Coordinape Circles. 
If the contributor role is a recurring role that needs to be salaried, that role will be paid out through Coordinape's Fixed Payments tool, and they will not be eligible to receive GIVE. ???


## Spin out a Sub-DAO

When a Guild becomes self-sustaining and generates enough revenue to run independently, a proposal can be made in #dao-proposals to spin off the Guild into a Sub-DAO.

Although this could be a long-term goal for a guild, the Community will ensure through governance that they agree with the spin-off to ensure continuity of the Guild and Contributor.

---

# Part Five: Working With WGMI 

WGMI is a service DAO offering three primary types of service:
* Foundational: Audits, success plans, system setup and optimization, etc. 
* Strategic: Community strategy, playbooks, advising, counseling, etc. 
* Tactical: Technical content creation, Community Initiatives, etc. 

Operationally, our objective is to work and partner with high quality, revenue generating, and web3 ecosystem-enriching organizations. 

Learn more [on our website](https://www.wgmi.community/work-with-us)! 

---

## Hire Us and Partner
To hire a community professional at WGMI, clients will have to go through our simple onboarding process. 

1. Head over to the WGMI Discord Server here.
1. Go through our verification process.
1. Once verified, head to the `#path-selection` channel.
1. Choose the "partner" emoji.
1. Open a ticket in the `#partner-path` channel.

You will then be in contact with the folks at our Partnership Guild who will get you started with WGMI introductions and partnership discussions.

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rklmgl2ki.png)

## Working with WGMI
There are a few ways to work with WGMI. The first step is submitting the [Service Inquiry Form](https://airtable.com/shrpATU35UP7Q1KWL) so we have an idea of the project and if we can help! The more info you can share upfront, the better :) 

1. **Hire WGMI Consulting** 
WGMI Consulting is a vetted team of Community & DAO Experts working with clients and partners on community design, growth, and overall strategy. These are paid engagements with the Service Guild operating as a consultancy. The work is done for a monthly retainer, or a fixed-scope lump sum payment, with a portion funding the WGMI DAO treasury. WGMI Consulting will source contributors from WGMI DAO for projects as required. 
2. **Propose a volunteer project**  
If funds are tight but you have a dope project, then WGMI is still down to explore working together! WGMI can post the project to one of the guilds to see if anybody wants to volunteer their time to it. Depending on the project and traction, DAO council may consider allocating DAO shares or contributor NFTs in exchange for the work. 
3. **Grant**
If the project has a narrow scope, short timeline and 10x public goods outcomes, WGMI can seek a grant to fund the project. Various web3 projects in the Ethereum ecosystem provide grants for work that brings the ecosystem forward. For example, grants can be used to fund education initiatives such as bootcamps, workshops, and targeted trainings.  



## Convert a Client Submission
1. Send over the project scope and details via the [Service Inquiry Form](https://airtable.com/shrpATU35UP7Q1KWL)
2. WGMI Service Guild  to review the submission and schedule a call if the project is a good fit for a service, volunteer, or grant project
    A. If not, WGMI will do our best to provide recommendations on alternative next steps  
4. Should both parties decide to work together, then we'll finalize Scope of Work/contract, invoicing, and project team 
5. Project kickoff!  

## Commission Process 
Once the project is active, the contributor(s) leading the consultation are responsible for gathering additional project members/resources as is necessary to scope out the full project. 

All contributors participating in the project **Discovery** and **Plan** phases are entitled to compensation. A percentage (~3%) of the project budget will be allocated as a commission to the contributor(s) involved in planning and securing the project. The rest of the project budget allocations will be outlined upon invoicing.  

## Escrow 

### Deploying your Cohort/ Team
- For WGMI Consulting projects, Service Guild leads are responsible for the project kickoffs and will work closely with project leads and account managers to assign the project team and formally begin the work
- The project lead is responsible to put together a cohort/ team/ party/ sprint to deliver the work
    - E.g. team-skylabs-00 (gives people nostalgia when they look back on a project they ran with others on)
- For WGMI DAO Volunteer or Grant projects, this will be determined at the guild level with DAO Council input and guidance 

### Join a Cohort/ Team
- For WGMI Consulting, vetted WGMI DAO roles are eligible to participate in paid projects via the Service Guild. Service Guild leads will work with the Community and Contributor stewards to announce available project work to contributors. 
- For WGMI DAO Volunteer or Grant projects, these initiatives will be announced to the community on our social channels. If a Volunteer or Grant project has already started and you feel that you could add value please check with the project team if support is needed then align on deliverables and compensation (if any is available).

### Lead a Cohort/ Team 
So you've decided to take on moloch as a project lead overseeing successful end-to-end project delivery? That's right, you assume total responsibility for getting the work done when raising your hand to lead a project, *especially* a WGMI Consulting project offering professional services. 

We prioritize having fun at WGMI, but we prioritize delivering above all else. As Community Professionals, we need to lead by example to meet deadlines and be fully prepared to execute the deliverables at all costs. 

Though leading Volunteer, Grant or other non-consulting projects may not have immediate guaranteed economic benefits, there will be eyes on all individual contributions to WGMI that could provide rewards later... 

To lead a project, please do the following:
1. Confirm the project has passed all necessary proposals and approval channels (either you propose the project and it passes or you step up to lead a project at WGMI's request)
2. Determine required project roles and resources
3. Signal that you will be leading a project by posting in the dedicated channels of communication 
4. Establish a project plan for the project. This task is generally handled by Service Guild leads, but in the case this is you, please ensure a timeline, scope and budget is properly laid out to ensure expectations are aligned
5. Create a project team using availability tag in discord channels and tagging the relevant roles 
6. If a Client channel has not been started, please start one using the project name so others can easily identify the project. (i.e. #metacartel)
7. Start a #project channel and ensure access is restricted only to WGMI Members and Apprentices. 
8. While not mandatory, we strongly recommend setting up a Gnosis Safe Multisig Wallet for your project to manage project funds. This ensures that funding can be allocated and distributed with consensus from all participants.

**Standard project bounty recommendation:**
* 10% Treasury Fee — mandatory
* 5% Biz Dev
* 10% Account Manager
* 15% Project Manager
* 60% Community Manager(s)

This is meant to be an example framework and as such, different project breakdowns may vary. Our only ask is to honor the 10% treasury fee upon completion to continue growing and sustaining WGMI. 

# Ship a Cohort/ Team
Congratulations, you slayed moloch and are ready to ship the work. 

Please follow all steps outlined under the **Sunset** phase section of [WGMI's Delivery Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mNbdTmZtl5zt9C_mSo-TQPI1RNad37sJ4jsxlSFzObg/edit#) to officially deliver and offboard a project. 


# Part Six: DAO Operations 

---
# How we operate
Second to this Guidebook, Notion is WGMI's powerhouse, particularly because we are an asynchronous organization. General WGMI and Community resources are housed in Notion, as well as internal project and task tracking and management. See [WGMI Notion 101 Guide](https://app.tango.us/app/workflow/Season-1-2-Notion-Overview-2cc3c4d57a004151b0c6ac8332b1500d)   
- DAO daily tasks will be posted in Notion, dework, or at the guild or project level
- The DAO will generally operate with Seasons 
    - Cohorts may be within Seasons
- Monthly Town Halls
- Monthly Newsletters
- Weekly updates
- Please note that WGMI operations may change season over season :)

## Our Stack

- **Moloch v3**
    - We're summoning the core "DAO Council" using Moloch v2. Members are highly dedicated contributors and have skin in the game. We're incentivizing contributors who have worked for the DAO to be brought into the core DAO governance activities. This is mecca.
    - [Moloch v3 Repo](https://github.com/Moloch-Mystics/moloch-v3)
- **DAOHaus**
    - We are using DAOHaus to make our smart contract calls to Moloch more efficient and usable for "normies"/ non-technical DAO members. Anybody should be able to jump in, create an on-chain proposal, vote/ govern, and pass proposals democratically with clear guidelines.
        - How it works [Link]
- **Gnosis**
    - We're deploying Gnosis safes across Guilds. At the Guild level (working group schema), teams should be able to pull funds from the Guild quickly and efficiently for Cohorts (sprints).
        - How it works [Link]
- **Contributor Badges (NFTs)**
    - Over time, NFTs will be made available for individual contributors to buy their way into DAO work via cohorts. This is your medallion into Community Management. 
        - How it Works [Link]
- **Snapshot**
    - With that same NFT, we will use Snapshot to create signals from contributors of the DAO. You may only be here to work for one season, a cohort—but your opinion still matters.  
        - How it Works [Link]
- **Coordinape**
    - Coordinating is hard work and honest work (insert DeFi Famer meme)... We're using Coordinape to help Cohort contributors/ participants vote on who REALLY did the work for each sprint/ epoch/ cohort. Based on the results, those recognized will be allocated ERC-20s (DAI) from the Guild's Gnosis Multisig Safe.
        - How it Works [Link]
- **Forum**
    - Does your Guild need some capital? Summon a Community Funding Proposal! Does your Guild have some ideas on what they will prioritize? Summon a WGMI Improvement Proposal (WIP) for your Season!

# Part Seven: FAQ & Other Musings
Thoughts, answers, and working thoughts...

## Why Ethereum?
Ethereum is more than crypto. The future internet of value is sovereign, uncensorable, composable, self-custodial, and decentralized. The Ethereum protocol and Community brings together technology, ethos, and pathos that we align with and believe is the future internet. We're focused on this path and find more success in building directly for this ecosystem.

[More on Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/learn/)
## Is this Web3?
Ethereum is Web3. Other protocols aim to create a crypto-native internet layer, improve user ownership of data, enable the transfer of internet state, and create ways to tokenize value in various financial services or assets that can be sent across internet protocols.
